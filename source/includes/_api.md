This section describes how to establish yourself as a vendor of <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/single-click-apps/" target="_blank">Single-Click Apps</a> on the BigCommerce Apps Marketplace. Here are your first steps to get started:

## <span class="jumptarget"> 1. Join the Technology Partner Program </span>

Before you'll be ready to submit an app for the BigCommerce Marketplace, you must become an official Partner. BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Technology Partner Program. You can <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/signup" target="_blank">apply for a technology partnership here</a>. To be approved as a partner, you will need:

* A website.
* Intent to offer your app publicly.
* Ability to support users of your app.
* Evidence of expertise in app development.

<span class="aside-notice-hd">Notes</span><br>
  <ul>
	<li>If you are an existing BigCommerce partner, you do <em>not</em> need to re-apply for the Technology Partner Program.</li>
	<li>The email address you use in the partnership application form must be the same email address as you use to log into your sandbox store, and to log into <a href="//devtools.bigcommerce.com" target="_blank">My&#160;Apps</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</aside>

Once approved, you will receive one or more emails containing your partner credentials and next steps. Your Partner username and ID will be required to submit your app for <a href="https://developer.bigcommerce.com/" target="_blank">App Store</a> consideration.

<span class="aside-notice-hd">Note</span>

  <ul>
	<li>If you do not receive these credentials by email, please contact <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.
	</li>
  </ul>
</aside>


## <span class="jumptarget"> 2. Get a Sandbox Store </span>

To open your sandbox store, log into the Partner Portal, then click **Create a Trial Store**. When you log into your store, use the same email that you used when applying to become a Technology Partner.

NOTE: Although the **Create a Trial Store** option's name indicates that the store might be temporary, it is actually permanent.


## <span class="jumptarget">3. Create your Draft App </span>

Once you’re ready to start on your app, navigate to the Developer Portal home page, click the **My Apps** link, and log in using the same email address you've used for your sandbox store.

The **My Apps** page is where you will add, edit, and manage any of your BigCommerce Single-Click Apps. Start by clicking **Create an app now**, and initiating <a href="/api/#app-registration">registration of your app</a> - you can always come back to edit this later!

Once your draft app is created, you will be able to install and test it privately in your sandbox store.
 
<aside class="notice">
<span class="aside-notice-hd">Note</span>
	<br><br>
To access your draft app in the store, the email address used for your sandbox store’s Owner user must be identical to the address that you use for the BigCommerce Developer Portal. </ul>
</aside>

## <span class="jumptarget"> 4. Submit Your App </span>

Once your app is fully functional and meets all of BigCommerce’s <a href="#app-store-approval-requirements">approval requirements</a>, submit the app from **My Apps**. We will get back to you as soon as we have reviewed your submission.
