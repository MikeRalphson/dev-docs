# <span class="jumptarget"> Blueprint and Developer Mode </span>

## <span class="jumptarget"> A foundation for creating great themes </span>

When you are creating a new theme, our Blueprint  base theme makes a great starting point. Blueprint includes responsive support out-of-the-box, so it works with lower resolutions like those on mobile devices. The visual design has been stripped back, so you can create from a clean canvas.

## <span class="jumptarget"> Setting up your environment </span>

Follow these steps to start developing using the Blueprint theme:

1.  To enable the Blueprint theme on your store, simply log in to the control panel, and place <NOBR>`/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable` </nobr>after `/admin`.<br>
    (For example: <NOBR>`https://store-123abmy.mybigcommerce.com/admin/index.php?ToDo=viewTemplates&dev=enable`.</nobr>)
2.  Apply the Blueprint theme
3.  Connect to the site via <a href="https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Connecting-to-WebDav/" target="_blank">WebDAV</a>.
4.  Once connected via WebDav, navigate to the `/template/` folder, where you will have access to all the files that make up a theme.
5.  To make a change to a file, just download the file, edit it, and then upload your altered version.
6.  Every time you make changes to any files, you will need to upload them through WebDAV for the changes to be reflected on your site.
