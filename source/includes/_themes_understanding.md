# Understanding Themes

<!-- For information about our new themes framework, **Stencil**, please explore our [Stencil documentation](https://stencil.bigcommerce.com/docs/).

For information about our legacy  Blueprint themes framework, please follow the navigation links within this portal. -->

Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of Bigcommerce stores. The compelling store designs in the [BigCommerce&#160;Showcase](http://www.bigcommerce.com/showcase/) demonstrate the kinds of things that can be done.

To ensure that your themes make the most of BigCommerceâ€™s extensive out-of-the-box features and capabilities, please be aware of all the [supported features](https://www.bigcommerce.com/features/all/) that store owners manage and maintain through the Bigcommerce control panel.

You can ask further questions, and seek advice, in the [Developer Forum](https://forum.bigcommerce.com/s/group/0F913000000HLjECAW). For professional assistance in customizing a theme, consider hiring a [BigCommerce Expert](http://www.bigcommerce.com/experts/).
