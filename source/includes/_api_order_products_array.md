## <span class="jumptarget"> Order Products Array </span>

|||
|---|---|
| Managed by | [Orders Resource](#orders)

Nested inside the <a href="/api/objects/v2/#orders">`order`</a> object, the `products` object/array allows you to achieve several goals:

* When retrieving order(s) using a `GET`, the `products` array provides JSON and XML summaries of the product(s) in the order. For an example of the syntax, see the sample code in [List Orders](#list-orders).

* When sending order(s) using a `POST` or `PUT`, the `products` array allows you to add either a product that already exists in the store, or a product that does not exist in the store. For an example of the syntax, see the sample code in [Create an Order](#create-an-order).

<aside class="warning">
<span class="aside-warning-hd">Updates Are Additive</span><br><br>
Values passed for the <code>products</code> array to a <code>PUT</code> are appended to any existing values. You cannot use a <code>PUT</code> to overwrite existing <code>products</code> values.
