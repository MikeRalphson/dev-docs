## <span class="jumptarget"> App Submission </span>

When you first get up and running with your app development, you will leave many fields in `My Apps` blank, as discussed in the [App&#160;Registration](#app-registration) section. Before submitting your app for consideration, you must come back through the `My Apps` wizard and fill in the missing information. This section discusses each page of the wizard, and identifies the information and files required for App Store approval.

<aside class="warning">
<span class="aside-warning-hd">Check for Complete Information</span><br><br>
The wizard validates for your Partner username and ID, as well as for correctly formatted URLs. However, additional information is required to get your app accepted into the App Store.<br><br> 

If you submit your app without the required information and files identified in this section, it will be rejected.

### <span class="jumptarget"> App Summary

The required fields in the `App Summary` panel are identified and discussed below:

*   `Username`: your Partner account user name.

*   `Partner ID`: your Partner account ID.

*   `Logo`: upload the image that you want to be displayed in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/" target="_blank">App Store</a>. To ensure optimal quality, you should use your image processing software to size it to 340 by 160 pixels before uploading.

*   `Price`: defaults to `Free`. If you do not want to receive any payment for your app, you can leave this in place. Otherwise, select the price that you want to charge merchants. NOTE: if you select `Free Trial`, make sure that you select a price to charge at the end of the trial period.

<aside class="notice">
<span class="aside-notice-hd">Free-Trial Templates</span><br><br>
The App Summary price setting offers several predefined formats that include an optional Free Trial. Where possible, we suggest using these, to offer merchants uniform formatting in the App Store.
</aside>

*   `Summary`: A brief description of your app (your value proposition) to show alongside the logo in the <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/" target="_blank">App Store</a>. Maximum length is 140 characters.

*   `Category`: Select a minimum of one, maximum of two.

### <span class="jumptarget"> Details </span>

All of the fields in the `Details` panel are required. Each is discussed below:

*   `App Details`: Provide a helpful description to promote your app (maximum 250 words). We recommend including an introduction video, bullet points, short paragraphs, and any restrictions (countries, browsers, payment methods, etc). 

*   `App Screenshots`: You must include at least one, and may include up to four. Each screenshot should be 860 by 560 pixels.

### <span class="jumptarget"> Launch Bar </span>

You must provide an app icon. To ensure optimal quality, you should use your image processing software to size it to 100 by 100 pixels before uploading. Your app icon will appear in the merchant's control panel once your app has been installed.

### <span class="jumptarget"> Technical </span>

You will have already provided much of the information during the initial [app registration](#app-registration). However, before submitting your app, please review the information that you initially provided, to make sure that all of the URIs are publicly available, fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL. In addition, ensure that your app is requesting all of the scopes that it needs now, as well as the scopes that you anticipate needing in the future.

Prior to submission, you must also provide detailed testing instructions, as well as test accounts.

<aside class="warning">
<span class="aside-warning-hd">Scope Changes</span><br><br>
Changing scopes once your app has been launched will require all of your current users to re-authorize the app before they can launch it again.
</aside>


### <span class="jumptarget"> Submitting your App </span>

You can submit your app from the last panel. A fee of $99 is required for each submission. If your app is rejected and you need to resubmit it, _you will be charged again,_ so be sure that it's ready for review before submitting. Updates to the app will not require an additional submission fee.

After receiving the submission, BigCommerce will use the information that you have provided to interact with, evaluate, and test your app.
