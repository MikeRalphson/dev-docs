# Blueprint Themes

## Getting Started with Blueprint

**To replace the large tiles below:** Here are the building blocks of Blueprint themes:  

### [Layouts](/themes/blueprint/layouts)  
  
	Layout templates provide the base HTML structure that wraps storefront page content. Each layout file corresponds to a specific page, and typically contains references to individual panels to be shown on a page.

### [Panels](/themes/blueprint/panels)  

	Panels provide reusable blocks of content. Panels are contained in div tags that generally define a page's left, center, or right column. Panels can contain content, or can generate content dynamically.

### [Snippets](/themes/blueprint/snippets)  
 
	Snippets are templates containing a fragment of HTML that can be embedded multiple times on a page.	

### [Styles](/themes/blueprint/#style-guidelines)  
 
	These are the theme's primary layout stylesheets, with styles.css being the core file.
