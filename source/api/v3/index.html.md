# API v3 Documentation

The Bigcommerce Stores API features a RESTful architecture, allowing you to code in the language of your choice. This API supports the JSON media type, and uses UTF-8 character encoding.

All connections require authentication, and are secured by TLS encryption. As of June 30, 2016, all requests must support Server Name Indication (SNI).

With clever use of this API, you can automate various commerce, business, and publishing tasks and integrate all kinds of apps with our platform.
